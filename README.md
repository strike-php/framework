Strike is a lean PHP web application framework. It tries to fill the gap between
micro frameworks which do not offer enough features and full frameworks which offer
too many features in a too opinionated way.

Strike offers features like:

* Fast routing with middleware support
* Dependency Injection Container with auto resolution
* Easy logging with multiple drivers
* Powerful CLI based on symfony/console
